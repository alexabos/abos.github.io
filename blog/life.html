  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi everyone, I'm Alex, and I'm thrilled to have you visiting my blog! </p>
<br> <br>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">I'm a Data Scientist and Biomedical Engineer currently working as Statistical Forecaster in the biopharmaceutical company Sanofi. I'm also a Doctor by the University of Barcelona (yes, a PhD, not a MD... Sorry guys, I don't know about diseases if that's what you were gonna ask me about).
  My thesis was about MRI Connectomics and machine learning in movement disorders, in collaboration with the Hospital Clinic. </p>

<br> <br>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from my work in the healthcare sector (which I adore!), I enjoy being a data scientist so I love taking part in as many data science competitions as I can! I usually participate in datathons as Random6 (visit our github to know more about our cool projects). </p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <p style="text-align: justify;">But of course, work is not everything! Even engineers deserve some Netflix and chill from time to time (there're so many cool TV shows nowadays, so who can blame me?)</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">I've being playing the saxophone since I'm eight, and even though now I'm not currently part of any band, I enjoy playing jazz songs.
  I also enjoy reading (such a cliché haha), so many books and so little time! And I must confess JP Sartre is my favourite philosopher: "l'existence précède l'essence" is such an inspiring quote! And apart from all these indoors activities, I love exercising, go trekking and exploring new countries. </p>
<br> <br>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to contact me!  </p>
